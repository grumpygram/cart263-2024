# Template p5 project

This is the final assignment for CART 263, the description of what it does is at the top of the script file, but it is a program that judges outfit quality based on contrast and recommends different colour schemes based on a triadic colour scheme. To use the program, you have to click either of the two buttons on the left of the screen, depending on what function you wish to use. Unfortunately, I didn't give myself time to properly figure out how to make a spot to upload a photo in the UI, so the photos have to be added to the assets folder to work.
